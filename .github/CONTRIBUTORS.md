## UI Design

> This category is for people who have helped design the user interface of Stump. This can be things like designing a new page or laying out the UX for a new feature. Assets like figma files and mockups won't be stored on the repo, but if you'd like to share them please feel free to link them in your entry here.

## Planning and Organization

> This category is for people who have helped plan and organize Stump. This can be things like solving a problem Stump faces during a solutioning / planning session, without actually coding anything. Typically, this will be reserved for those who take on `investigate` issues.
